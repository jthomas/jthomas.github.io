  <div class="post">
    <p>Last week was <a href="http://monkigras.com">Monki Gras</a>, the conference organised by
<a href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk</a>, with this year&rsquo;s theme being &ldquo;<em>scaling craft</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We plan to explore Craft that helps scale Technology, or Technology that helps
scale Craft. What are the limits of a craft-based approach? Does quality have
to suffer as businesses scale?
James Governor <a href="http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2013/01/07/scaling-craft-tech-and-beer-monki-gras-conference-2013/">http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2013/01/07/scaling-craft-tech-and-beer-monki-gras-conference-2013/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Held over two days in London&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/">Conway Hall</a>,
there was an incredible <a href="http://monkigras.com/agenda/">line-up of speakers</a>,
social events and <a href="http://www.londonfieldsbrewery.co.uk/">evening activities</a>.</p>
<p>Talks were on a diverse range of topics, from best practices for scaling virtual teams to printing your own steam train. Here are my notes
on those I found most interesting (or, more likely, remembered to write something down&hellip;).</p>
<h2 id="rafe-colburnhttprc3org---artisan-software-manufacture"><a href="http://rc3.org/">Rafe Colburn</a> - &ldquo;Artisan Software Manufacture&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Rafe started his talk by defining characteristics associated with craft and
mass production, which are normally held up as polar opposites.  Traditionally,
craft became a byword for quality, whereas mass production signalled
consistency and resilience. Combining aspects from both domains will often lead
to the best results.</p>
<p>Consider Apple&rsquo;s tag line these days, <em>designed in California, produced in
China</em>, craft and mass production.</p>
<p>When running an engineering team at <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a>, Rafe detailed the best practices they
used to ensure they shipped high quality software.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Measure and monitor everything</em> - This spans all areas of engineering from user
request metrics produced by the site, application errors generated and enormous A/B testing, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Automate repeatable processes</em> - New developer can be set-up straight away due to their use of VMs, allowing them to
start shipping straight away. Continuous integration and automated deployment were core principles of their engineering set-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Growing Craftmanship</em> - Etsy encouraged &ldquo;craftmanship&rdquo; as a culture internally through activities such as regular
code reviews, annual bootcamps to shift developers between different teams, scheduled &ldquo;bug rotations&rdquo; to mix developers together to tackle
the bug queue and code reading clubs, where developers review open-source software together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, spend the time saved on the most important aspect of software development, your employees and keeping them happy.</p>
<h2 id="phil-gilberthttpdesignibmcom---design-thinking-at-ibm"><a href="http://design.ibm.com">Phil Gilbert</a> - &ldquo;Design Thinking at IBM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>IBM&rsquo;s CEO, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginni_Rometty">Ginni Rometty</a>, recently announced a new division to lead design
across the entire company, cutting through the individual brands and products,
transforming IBM into a design-led company.</p>
<p>With close to 480,000 employees,
this is a herculean task and Phil Gilbert has been put in charge.
Phil previously led the effort to consolidate IBM&rsquo;s BPM portfolio down from nearly
twenty products to only four.</p>
<p>His team has developed a new framework to deliver
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginni_Rometty"><strong>&ldquo;design-led thinking&rdquo;</strong></a> throughout IBM, rather than a formulaic set of policies
and procedures to enforce design from top-down.</p>
<p>Using the military analogy of
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/frontline-leadership/2010/11/dont-play-golf-in-a-football-g.html">Commander&rsquo;s intent</a>
, the goal was to empower product teams within IBM to embrace design-led thinking, rather than appearing
as &ldquo;just another corporate diktat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Key building blocks in the framework were&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Lead Users</em> - Continual and regular engagement with intended consumers straight from the design phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Release Hills</em> - Used to split design and development effort into achievable iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Metrics</em> - Provide visibility around objective operational data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Wiki-based Release BluePrint</em> - Used as source of truth within project, peer-reviewed artifacts, shared between consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Full details about this new initiative can be found on the <a href="http://design.ibm.com/uxd/design.jsp?site=home&amp;top=x1&amp;left=y3">IBM Design</a> site.</p>
<h2 id="steve-citron-poustyhttpstwittercomthesteve0---ecosystem-management-brings-the-science-to-scaling"><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSteve0">Steve Citron-Pousty</a> - &ldquo;Ecosystem management brings the science to scaling&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Steve knows a thing or two about &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo;, working as a developer advocate
for Red Hat and having a PhD in Ecology.</p>
<p>Drawing on his past experience from
academia, Steve talked about using lessons learned from real ecosystem
management, specifically Yellowstone Natural Park, to enable more effective
developer outreach programmes.</p>
<p>Ecosystems experiments come in different forms, natural (let&rsquo;s observe the
effects of a natural disaster) and planned (let&rsquo;s introduce a
new species), choosing the right experiment type can greatly improve the
results.</p>
<p>Add monitoring to your ecosystem experiments, e.g. A/B testing on click-through rates for
email marketing, allowing you to perform statistical analysis to quantatively
assess the outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="donnie-berkholzhttpredmonkcomdberkholz---what-data-scientist-can-learn-from-devops"><a href="http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/">Donnie Berkholz</a> - &ldquo;What Data Scientist Can Learn From DevOps&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Donnie Berkholz, analyst at Redmonk, was previous a biological researcher
working on drug discovery. His talk expanded from this
<a href="http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2012/11/06/what-can-data-scientists-learn-from-devops/">article</a>
about how data scientists could benefit from applying &ldquo;engineering culture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The main theme was that traditional statisticians come from a world
built with custom scripts using R, hand-written log books and manual analysis.
As &ldquo;data scientists&rdquo; merge this existing world with better technologies there
was an enormous amount of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; from software engineering that could
be applied with great success.</p>
<p>Concrete suggestions included source control for artifacts, continuous testing for
code and data, online collaboration using wikis and engineering for scale.</p>
<p>Slides for the talk are available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dberkholz/data-science-devops-and-drinks-the-perfect-combination">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="shanley-kanehttpprettylittlestatemachinecom---scaling-product-management"><a href="http://prettylittlestatemachine.com/">Shanley Kane</a> - &ldquo;Scaling Product Management&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Shanley compared [Dante&rsquo;s Inferno](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante</a>)) to
Product Management, using the nine circles of Hell as metaphors for common issues
and providing solutions from Paradiso and the spheres of Heaven.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Fraud</em> - Roadmaps are arbitrary documents with timelines and feature. Premature
decision making that encourages death marches.  Remove road maps and
collaborate on living &ldquo;working what are working on&rdquo; document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Greed</em> - You can&rsquo;t do everything you want (within a fixed time period).
Shanley&rsquo;s heuristic says, <em>&ldquo;take what you want to do, divide it by four, take
the original time you think you need and double it&rdquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gluttony</em> - Stop using &ldquo;all the tools&rdquo;. Perfect tools don&rsquo;t exist, lower your expectations and standardise across teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Limbo</em> - Technical debt hinder progress, grows over time. Stop hiding it away, acknowledge it and plan to resolve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anger</em> - Continually dismissing peoples&rsquo; opinions leads to distrust and resentment. Create culture of discussion, including trade-offs and whys. Include
other departments apart from engineering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tim-webbhttpstwittercomtim_webb_---tips--tricks-and-tools-from-a-company-thats-never-had-a-headquarters"><a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Webb_">Tim Webb</a> - &ldquo;Tips &amp; tricks, and tools from a company that&rsquo;s never had a headquarters.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Tim&rsquo;s talked about scaling remote-working teams and how his company makes it
work.</p>
<p>Setting expectations was key to successful collaboration, how available
are people supposed to be during core working hours?</p>
<p>Remote working can be
successful but you can&rsquo;t ignore physical distances, having a team with
employees in Latin America, United Kingdom and China makes it difficult to even
schedule a conference call.</p>
<p>Use tools a variety of tools, from Google Hangouts
to Skype, to encourage collaboration. Default to &ldquo;over-sharing&rdquo; to ensure
everybody stays in touch.</p>
<h2 id="ted-nymanhttpstwittercomtnm---scaling-happiness"><a href="https://twitter.com/tnm">Ted Nyman</a> - &ldquo;Scaling Happiness&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Github has now grown to over 140 employees but still hasn&rsquo;t employed a formal manager.</p>
<p>Rather than having a hierarchical organisational, with managers dictating strategy and direction,
Github&rsquo;s engineer&rsquo;s work on what they find most interesting and progress happens through consensus and
discussion.</p>
<p>Ted spoke about &ldquo;freedom perks&rdquo;, calling out companies who use excessive benefits, e.g. free food,
rather than engaging work to hold onto employees.</p>
<p><em>Authenticity and autonomy are key to happiness for employees.</em></p>
<p>Github&rsquo;s lack of a formal structure creates a culture which embraces disorder, tolerates mistakes and lets teams
form naturally. This culture eventually reinforces the original structure.</p>
<p>Slides are available <a href="http://ted.io/scaling-happiness.html">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to next year already&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finally, thanks to <a href="http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a> and the rest of the organisers for putting on a fantastic event.
It must have taken an enormous amount of effort to pull off a high-quality event on this scale.</strong></p>
