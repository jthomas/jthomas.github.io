      <description>This blog post is the final part of a series on &amp;ldquo;Monitoring Serverless Applications Metrics&amp;rdquo;. See the introduction post for details and links to other posts.
In previous blog posts, we showed how to capture serverless metrics from IBM Cloud Functions, send those values into the IBM Cloud Monitoring service and build visualisation dashboards using Grafana.
Dashboards are a great way to monitor metrics but rely on someone watching them! We need a way to be alerted to issues without having to manually review dashboards.</description>

      <description>This blog post is part three of a series on &amp;ldquo;Monitoring Serverless Applications Metrics&amp;rdquo;. See the introduction post for details and links to other posts.
Having configured collecting serverless metrics from IBM Cloud Functions (Apache OpenWhisk) applications, monitoring incoming metric values will alert us to problems.
IBM Cloud Monitoring provides a Grafana-based service to help with this.
 Grafana is an open source metric analytics &amp;amp; visualization suite. It is most commonly used for visualizing time series data for infrastructure and application analytics.</description>

      <description>Serverless applications are not &amp;ldquo;No Ops&amp;rdquo;, despite the meme. ðŸ™„
Monitoring runtime metrics is still crucial for serverless applications. Identifying, diagnosing and resolving issues in production requires data on execution durations, errors thrown, resource usage statistics amongst other metrics.
IBM Cloud has a comprehensive series of tools for monitoring application metrics. In this blog post series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at using these tools to monitor metrics from serverless applications. ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</description>
