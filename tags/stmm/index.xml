      <description>How do you manage files for a serverless application? 🤔
Previous blog posts discussed this common problem and introduced the most popular solution, using a cloud-based object storage service. 👏👏👏
Object stores provide elastic storage in the cloud, with a billing model which charges for capacity used. These services are the storage solution for serverless applications, which do not have access to a traditional file system. 👍
