      <description>Following all the events from the World Cup can be hard. So many matches, so many goals. Rather than manually refreshing BBC Football to check the scores, I decided to created a Twitter bot that would automatically tweet out each goal.
The Twitter bot runs on IBM Cloud Functions. It is called once a minute to check for new goals, using the alarm trigger feed. If new goals have been scored, it calls another action to send the tweet messages.</description>
