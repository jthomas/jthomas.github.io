      <description>Following all the events from the World Cup can be hard. So many matches, so many goals. Rather than manually refreshing BBC Football to check the scores, I decided to created a Twitter bot that would automatically tweet out each goal.
The Twitter bot runs on IBM Cloud Functions. It is called once a minute to check for new goals, using the alarm trigger feed. If new goals have been scored, it calls another action to send the tweet messages.</description>

      <description>Binding service credentials to actions and packages is a much better approach to handling authentication credentials in IBM Cloud Functions, than manually updating (and maintaining) default parameters üîê.
IBM Cloud Functions supports binding credentials from IAM-based and Cloud Foundry provisioned services.
Documentation and blog posts demonstrating service binding focuses on traditional platform services, created using the Cloud Foundry service broker. As IBM Cloud integrates IAM across the platform, more platform services will migrate to use the IAM service for managing authentication credentials.</description>
