      <description>Last week was Monki Gras, the conference organised by RedMonk, with this year&amp;rsquo;s theme being &amp;ldquo;scaling craft&amp;quot;.
 We plan to explore Craft that helps scale Technology, or Technology that helps scale Craft. What are the limits of a craft-based approach? Does quality have to suffer as businesses scale? James Governor http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2013/01/07/scaling-craft-tech-and-beer-monki-gras-conference-2013/
 Held over two days in London&amp;rsquo;s Conway Hall, there was an incredible line-up of speakers, social events and evening activities.</description>
