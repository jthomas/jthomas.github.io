      <title>Cognitive Bots With IBM Watson</title>

      <description>Later this month, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at Twilio&amp;rsquo;s conference about building cognitive bots with IBM Watson. Preparing for this presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with the IBM Watson services to build sample bots that can understand, and act on, natural language.
IBM&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence system, [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer), now provides a series of &amp;ldquo;cognitive&amp;rdquo; services available through IBM&amp;rsquo;s Bluemix cloud platform. Developers can integrate everything from natural language processing, image and speech recognition, emotion analysis and more into their applications using RESTful APIs.</description>

      <title>Updated IBM Watson Nodes for Node-RED</title>

      <description>Earlier this year, I made a major upate to the Node-RED nodes for the IBM Watson services available through IBM Bluemix. Since then, the IBM Watson team has been busy, with lots of changes to APIs. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working through these changes, updating the nodes, to ensure they work against the latest APIs.
Updates to these nodes have now been finished and are available through the boilerplate on IBM Bluemix or by installing the IBM Bluemix Nodes package locally.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a number of updates to the Node-RED nodes for the IBM Bluemix platform&amp;hellip;
Highlights below:
New AlchemyAPI Nodes There are two new nodes (Feature Extract and Image Extract) in the package, allowing users to call services from the AlchemyAPI platform.
  Feature Extract. This node will analyse external URLs, HTML or text content with features for text-based analysis from the AlchemyAPI service, e.g. keywords, sentiment, relationships, etc.</description>

      <title>IBM Watson Nodes For Node-RED</title>
      <link>https://jamesthom.as/2015/04/ibm-watson-nodes-for-node-red/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the IBM Watson Nodes for Node-RED to include seven extra services.
Previously, the package only provided support for the following services:
 Language Identification. Machine Translation. Question &amp;amp; Answers.  With the recent code changes, users now have access to the additional services:
 Message Resonance. Personality Insights. Relationship Extraction. Speech to Text. Text to Speech. Tradeoff Analytics. Visual Recognition.  Using Node-RED through the IBM Bluemix boilerplate will automatically include the IBM Watson modules in the palette.</description>

      <title>Doctor Watson</title>

      <description>Doctor Watson is an IBM Bluemix application to answer medical questions over the phone, using IBM Watson and Twilio.
Ringing an external phone number, the application will answer and ask for a medical question to help with. Translating your speech into text and using IBM Watson&amp;rsquo;s Question and Answer service, Doctor Watson will query the medical corpus.
Top rated answers will be converted to speech and used as a response over the phone.</description>

      <title>London JS - Watson</title>
      <link>https://jamesthom.as/2012/10/london-js-watson/</link>

      <description>Last month, I was invited to speak at LondonJS on the machine learning and artificial intelligence behind IBM Watson.
I jokingly said the talk would win the prize for the &amp;ldquo;least amount of JavaScript-related content in a LondonJS talk&amp;rdquo;.
The idea was to introduce the audience to topics (machine learning) that might be relevant in the future and IBM Watson was a great example that people love hearing about.
Slides for the event are now posted online, check them out here.</description>
