      <description>This is smsbot.
It provides an integration with Slack that connects SMS messages into channels. People can text an external number and have their messages posted into the channel. Channel users can respond to the messages and have their response sent back to the sender using SMS.
 smsbot was developed in under a few hours and less than one hundred lines of code using a serverless cloud platform.

      <description>Later this month, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at Twilio&amp;rsquo;s conference about building cognitive bots with IBM Watson. Preparing for this presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with the IBM Watson services to build sample bots that can understand, and act on, natural language.
IBM&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence system, [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer), now provides a series of &amp;ldquo;cognitive&amp;rdquo; services available through IBM&amp;rsquo;s Bluemix cloud platform. Developers can integrate everything from natural language processing, image and speech recognition, emotion analysis and more into their applications using RESTful APIs.</description>
