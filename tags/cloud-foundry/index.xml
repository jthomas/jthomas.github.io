      <title>Cloud Foundry Application Monitoring Bot For Slack</title>

      <description>Cloud Foundry makes it so easy to build, deploy and manage applications that it can be a struggle just to keep up with development progress&amp;hellip;
 &amp;ldquo;Who is restarting this application?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What is this new service instance?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;When did this application instance run out of memory?&amp;rdquo;
 Development teams are increasingly using Slack to collaborate on projects and using custom bots to manage and monitor applications, triggered through the channel messages.</description>

      <title>Node.js v4 in Cloud Foundry</title>
      <link>https://jamesthom.as/2015/09/node.js-v4-in-cloud-foundry/</link>

      <description>Last week, Node.js released the latest version of their project, v4.0.0. This release, representing the convergence of io.js with the original Node.js project, came with lots of exciting features like improved ES6 support.
Cloud Foundry already supports multiple versions of the Node.js runtime. Developers select the desired runtime version using a parameter in their application&amp;rsquo;s package descriptor.
So, we just update package.json to include &amp;ldquo;4.0.0&amp;rdquo; and re-deploy our application?
Not yet.</description>

      <description>Routing application traffic based upon the geographic location of incoming requests can be used for a number of scenarios&amp;hellip;
 Restricting access to your application outside defined geographic regions. Load-balancing traffic to the closest region for improved performance. Providing custom applications for different countries.  IBM Bluemix allows deploying applications to different geographic regions through hosting instances of the Cloud Foundry platform in multiple locations.
Cloud Foundry supports simple HTTP routing rules for deployed applications.</description>

      <title>running one-off tasks in cloud foundry</title>

      <description>Whether making changes to a database schema, bulk importing data to initialise a database or setting up a connected service, there are often administrative tasks that needed to be carried out for an application to run correctly.
These tasks usually need finishing before starting the application and should not be executed more than once.
Previously, the CF CLI provided commands, tunnel and console, to help running one-off tasks manually. These commands were deprecated with the upgrade from v5 to v6 to discourage snowflake environments.</description>

      <description>Recent changes to the Cloud Foundry stacks supported by IBM Bluemix have led to a number of issues for users. I&amp;rsquo;ve helped users diagnose and fix issues that have occurred due to a mistmatches between the platform stack, applications and the buildpack. Learning a number of techniques for helping to discover and resolve these issues and I wanted to share them with everyone else.
Running on Cloud Foundry&amp;rsquo;s Platform-as-a-Service solution, we take for granted that low-level concepts like operating systems are abstracted away from the developer.</description>

      <title>Making Logs Awesome - Elasticsearch in the Cloud using Docker</title>

      <description>Logs are boring. It used to be the only time you&amp;rsquo;d be looking at your application logs was when something went wrong.
Logs filled up disk space until they rotated out of existence.
&amp;hellip;but now businesses are increasingly focused on using data to drive decisions.
Which advert leads to the highest click-through rates?
How did that last website change affect user retention?
What customer devices should our website support?
Guess where the answers lie?</description>

      <title>Continuous Delivery for Phonebot</title>

      <description>Since creating Phonebot last month, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on setting up a fully-automated build and deploy for the project. Using IBM DevOps Services, Phonebot now has &amp;ldquo;Continuous Delivery&amp;rdquo; enabled.
When new code is commited to the external Github repository, the build service will perform the following tasks.
 Run Unit Tests and Code Lint Tools Deploy To Test Server Run Integration Tests Against Test Server Deploy To Production  Each stage will only be executed if the following stage passes.</description>

      <title>Creating CF CLI Plugins</title>

      <description>Since the v.6.7 release of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CF CLI), users have been to create and install plugins to provide custom commands.
There&amp;rsquo;s now a whole community of third-party plugins to help make you more productive developing Cloud Foundry applications.
Installing Plugins Plugins can be installed directly from the platform binary.
$ go get github.com/sample_user/sample_plugin $ cf install-plugin $GOPATH/bin/sample_plugin &amp;hellip;or discovered and installed directly from plugin repositories.</description>

      <title>Cloud Foundry Custom Buildpacks</title>
      <link>https://jamesthom.as/2015/03/cloud-foundry-custom-buildpacks/</link>

      <guid>https://jamesthom.as/2015/03/cloud-foundry-custom-buildpacks/</guid>
      <description>Cloud Foundry Buildpacks provide runtime and framework support for applications. Users can rely on the built-in selection for Java, NodeJS, Python, etc. or additional community buildpacks from Github.
Buildpacks are open-source, making them simple to customise and include libraries needed by your application.
Doctor Watson uses an NPM module that relies on a command-line application, SOX, being installed in the runtime environment.
Making this command-line application available on the platform required the project to create a custom NodeJS buildpack.</description>

      <title>Zero Downtime Deployments Using IBM Bluemix</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a video I&amp;rsquo;ve made showing you how to deploy new versions of an application on IBM Bluemix without the end-user having to suffer any down time:
Utilising the Blue Green deployment pattern, we deploy the new version to a separate host within the production environment, rather than taking down and updating the existing application. The HTTP router in front of the applications controls tunnelling application requests between the different versions.</description>
