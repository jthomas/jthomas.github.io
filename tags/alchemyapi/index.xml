      <description>Earlier this year, I made a major upate to the Node-RED nodes for the IBM Watson services available through IBM Bluemix. Since then, the IBM Watson team has been busy, with lots of changes to APIs. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working through these changes, updating the nodes, to ensure they work against the latest APIs.
Updates to these nodes have now been finished and are available through the boilerplate on IBM Bluemix or by installing the IBM Bluemix Nodes package locally.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a number of updates to the Node-RED nodes for the IBM Bluemix platform&amp;hellip;
Highlights below:
New AlchemyAPI Nodes There are two new nodes (Feature Extract and Image Extract) in the package, allowing users to call services from the AlchemyAPI platform.
  Feature Extract. This node will analyse external URLs, HTML or text content with features for text-based analysis from the AlchemyAPI service, e.g. keywords, sentiment, relationships, etc.</description>
