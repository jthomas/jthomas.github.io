      <description>Last month, I was invited to speak at LondonJS on the machine learning and artificial intelligence behind IBM Watson.
I jokingly said the talk would win the prize for the &amp;ldquo;least amount of JavaScript-related content in a LondonJS talk&amp;rdquo;.
The idea was to introduce the audience to topics (machine learning) that might be relevant in the future and IBM Watson was a great example that people love hearing about.
Slides for the event are now posted online, check them out here.</description>

      <description>Dojo 1.7 was released this month, giving users early access to lots of features that are going to be standard in Dojo 2.0, due late 2012. We&amp;rsquo;ve already been using early releases of Dojo 1.7 since the summer in my day-to-day role with IBM working on Watson, as we wanted to take advantage of the new module format, better mobile support and much more. With 1.7 now available, I wanted to share my experiences using it on a real project, showing developers what new features are available, how they can use them and what advantages this brings.</description>
