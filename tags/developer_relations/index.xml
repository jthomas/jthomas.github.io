      <description>These are the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about Developer Relations, after over five years working as a Developer Advocate. They are based upon my own personal experiences and those of other advocates I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen advocates encounter the same challenges at different companies across the industry. I hope others can learn from my experiences, rather than repeating my mistakes!
background I worked as a Developer Advocate for IBM Cloud from 2014 to 2020.</description>
