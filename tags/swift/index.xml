      <description>In the previous blog post, we explained how to write Serverless Swift functions using OpenWhisk actions.
Swift sources files are compiled into a binary by the platform before processing requests.
This compilation process adds a delay on the invocation time for &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; runtimes. If the action has not been invoked for a while, the system is under heavy load or multiple invocations are received in parallel, a new runtime will need to be initialised.</description>

      <description>Swift is one of the fastest growing programming languages with developers.
 Swift has reached a Top 15 ranking faster than any other language we have tracked. RedMonk Programming Language Rankings http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/03/17/language-rankings-1-17/
 Created for building mobile applications, the language is now popular with backend development.
But for Swift developers beginning to build backend applications, they now find themselves having to manage computing infrastructure to run their applications in the cloud.</description>
