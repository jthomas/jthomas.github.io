      <description>Binding service credentials to actions and packages is a much better approach to handling authentication credentials in IBM Cloud Functions, than manually updating (and maintaining) default parameters üîê.
IBM Cloud Functions supports binding credentials from IAM-based and Cloud Foundry provisioned services.
Documentation and blog posts demonstrating service binding focuses on traditional platform services, created using the Cloud Foundry service broker. As IBM Cloud integrates IAM across the platform, more platform services will migrate to use the IAM service for managing authentication credentials.</description>
