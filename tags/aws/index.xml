      <description>I recently needed to share a static website with a third-party and secure the content against access by unauthorised users. The website should only be viewable with a username and password. Website files were static content - so could be served from a CDN-like service. All content must be served over HTTPS on a custom domain.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I accomplished this on AWS&amp;hellip;
AWS&amp;rsquo;s object store (S3) supports serving static web content directly from user buckets.</description>

      <title>AWS S3 IAM errors with missing files: 404 expected, 403 returned</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is AWS S3 returning authorisation errors (HTTP 403 responses) for bucket files that don&amp;rsquo;t exist (rather than HTTP 404 responses)? The IAM role has the correct permissions (s3:GetObject). If the bucket file is available - the content is returned as normal. This makes no sense, what is going on&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 This was me a few weeks ago. After losing too many hours debugging this issue (with no success), I reached out to Ant Stanley to check what I was missing.</description>
