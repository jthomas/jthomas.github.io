      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is AWS S3 returning authorisation errors (HTTP 403 responses) for bucket files that don&amp;rsquo;t exist (rather than HTTP 404 responses)? The IAM role has the correct permissions (s3:GetObject). If the bucket file is available - the content is returned as normal. This makes no sense, what is going on&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
