    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2018/08/07/machine-learning-in-node-dot-js-with-tensorflow-dot-js/">previous blog post</a>, I showed how to use <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a> on Node.js to run <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/145610bdeda2638d94fab9a397eb1f1d#file-script-js">visual recognition on images from the local filesystem</a>. TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript version of the open-source machine learning library from Google.</p>

<p>Once I had this working with a local Node.js script, my next idea was to convert it into a serverless function. Running this function on <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/">IBM Cloud Functions</a> (<a href="https://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a>) would turn the script into my own visual recognition microservice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tfjs-serverless/tf-js-example.gif" title="Serverless TensorFlow.js Function" ></p>

<p>Sounds easy, right? It's just a JavaScript library? So, zip it up and away we go... <strong><em>ahem</em></strong> 👊</p>

<p><em>Converting the image classification script to run in a serverless environment had the following challenges...</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TensorFlow.js libraries need to be available in the runtime.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Native bindings for the library must be compiled against the platform architecture.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Models files need to be loaded from the filesystem.</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these issues were more challenging than others to fix! Let's start by looking at the details of each issue, before explaining how <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2017/01/16/openwhisk-docker-actions/">Docker support</a> in Apache OpenWhisk can be used to resolve them all.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<h3>TensorFlow.js Libraries</h3>

<p>TensorFlow.js libraries are not included in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs">Node.js runtimes</a> provided by the Apache OpenWhisk.</p>

<p>External libraries <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/11/28/npm-modules-in-openwhisk/">can be imported</a> into the runtime by deploying applications from a zip file. Custom <code>node_modules</code> folders included in the zip file will be extracted in the runtime. Zip files are limited to a <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/reference.md#actions">maximum size of 48MB</a>.</p>

<h4>Library Size</h4>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> for the TensorFlow.js libraries used revealed the first problem... the resulting <code>node_modules</code> directory was 175MB. 😱</p>

<p>Looking at the contents of this folder, the <code>tfjs-node</code> module compiles a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node/tree/master/src">native shared library</a> (<code>libtensorflow.so</code>) that is 135M. This means no amount of JavaScript minification is going to get those external dependencies under the magic 48 MB limit. 👎</p>

<h4>Native Dependencies</h4>

<p>The <code>libtensorflow.so</code> native shared library must be compiled using the platform runtime. Running <code>npm install</code>  locally automatically compiles native dependencies against the host platform. Local environments may use different CPU architectures (Mac vs Linux) or link against shared libraries not available in the serverless runtime.</p>

<h3>MobileNet Model Files</h3>

<p>TensorFlow models files <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/model-save-load.html">need loading from the filesystem</a> in Node.js. Serverless runtimes do provide a temporary filesystem inside the runtime environment. Files from deployment zip files are automatically extracted into this environment before invocations. There is no external access to this filesystem outside the lifecycle of the serverless function.</p>

<p>Models files for the MobileNet model were 16MB. If these files are included in the deployment package, it leaves 32MB for the rest of the application source code. Although the model files are small enough to include in the zip file, what about the TensorFlow.js libraries? Is this the end of the blog post? Not so fast....</p>

<p><strong>Apache OpenWhisk's support for custom runtimes provides a simple solution to all these issues!</strong></p>

<h2>Custom Runtimes</h2>

<p>Apache OpenWhisk uses Docker containers as the runtime environments for serverless functions (actions). All platform runtime images are <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openwhisk/">published on Docker Hub</a>, allowing developers to start these environments locally.</p>

<p>Developers can also <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions-docker.md">specify custom runtime images</a> when creating actions. These images must be publicly available on Docker Hub. Custom runtimes have to expose the <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions-new.md#action-interface">same HTTP API</a> used by the platform for invoking actions.</p>

<p>Using platform runtime images as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=parent%20image">parent images</a> makes it simple to build custom runtimes. Users can run commands during the Docker build to install additional libraries and other dependencies. The parent image already contains source files with the HTTP API service handling platform requests.</p>

<h3>TensorFlow.js Runtime</h3>

<p>Here is the Docker build file for the Node.js action runtime with additional TensorFlow.js dependencies.</p>

<p>```
FROM openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8:latest</p>

<p>RUN npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/mobilenet @tensorflow/tfjs-node jpeg-js</p>

<p>COPY mobilenet mobilenet
```</p>

<p><code>openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8:latest</code> is the Node.js action runtime image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8/">published by OpenWhisk</a>.</p>

<p>TensorFlow libraries and other dependencies are installed using <code>npm install</code> in the build process. Native dependencies for the <code>@tensorflow/tfjs-node</code> library are automatically compiled for the correct platform by installing during the build process.</p>

<p>Since I'm building a new runtime, I've also added the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet">MobileNet model files</a> to the image. Whilst not strictly necessary, removing them from the action zip file reduces deployment times.</p>

<p><strong><em>Want to skip the next step? Use this image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesthomas/action-nodejs-v8/"><code>jamesthomas/action-nodejs-v8:tfjs</code></a> rather than building your own.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Building The Runtime</h3>

<p><em>In the <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2018/08/07/machine-learning-in-node-dot-js-with-tensorflow-dot-js/">previous blog post</a>, I showed how to download model files from the public storage bucket.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Download a version of the MobileNet model and place all files in the <code>mobilenet</code> directory.</li>
<li>Copy the Docker build file from above to a local file named <code>Dockerfile</code>.</li>
<li>Run the Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/">build command</a> to generate a local image.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
docker build -t tfjs .
</code></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/">Tag the local image</a> with a remote username and repository.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
docker tag tfjs &lt;USERNAME&gt;/action-nodejs-v8:tfjs
</code></p>

<p><em>Replace <code>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code> with your Docker Hub username.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/">Push the local image</a> to Docker Hub</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
 docker push &lt;USERNAME&gt;/action-nodejs-v8:tfjs
</code></p>

<p>Once the image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesthomas/action-nodejs-v8/">is available</a> on Docker Hub, actions can be created using that runtime image. 😎</p>

<h2>Example Code</h2>

<p>This source code implements image classification as an OpenWhisk action. Image files are provided as a Base64 encoded string using the <code>image</code> property on the event parameters. Classification results are returned as the <code>results</code> property in the response.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5.js"></script>


<h3>Caching Loaded Models</h3>

<p>Serverless platforms initialise runtime environments on-demand to handle invocations. Once a runtime environment has been created, it will be <a href="https://medium.com/openwhisk/squeezing-the-milliseconds-how-to-make-serverless-platforms-blazing-fast-aea0e9951bd0">re-used for further invocations</a> with some limits. This improves performance by removing the initialisation delay ("cold start") from request processing.</p>

<p>Applications can exploit this behaviour by using global variables to maintain state across requests. This is often use to <a href="https://blog.rowanudell.com/database-connections-in-lambda/">cache opened database connections</a> or store initialisation data loaded from external systems.</p>

<p>I have used this pattern to <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5#file-index-js-L80-L82">cache the MobileNet model</a> used for classification. During cold invocations, the model is loaded from the filesystem and stored in a global variable. Warm invocations then use the existence of that global variable to skip the model loading process with further requests.</p>

<p>Caching the model reduces the time (and therefore cost) for classifications on warm invocations.</p>

<h3>Memory Leak</h3>

<p>Running the Node.js script from blog post on IBM Cloud Functions was possible with minimal modifications. Unfortunately, performance testing revealed a memory leak in the handler function. 😢</p>

<p><em>Reading more about <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/core-concepts.html">how TensorFlow.js works</a> on Node.js uncovered the issue...</em></p>

<p>TensorFlow.js's Node.js extensions use a native C++ library to execute the Tensors on a CPU or GPU engine. Memory allocated for Tensor objects in the native library is retained until the application explicitly releases it or the process exits. TensorFlow.js provides a <code>dispose</code> method on the individual objects to free allocated memory. There is also a <code>tf.tidy</code> method to automatically clean up all allocated objects within a frame.</p>

<p>Reviewing the code, tensors were being created as <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5#file-index-js-L51-L59">model input from images</a> on each request. These objects were not disposed before returning from the request handler. This meant native memory grew unbounded. Adding an explicit <code>dispose</code> call to free these objects before returning <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5#file-index-js-L91">fixed the issue</a>.</p>

<h3>Profiling &amp; Performance</h3>

<p>Action code records memory usage and elapsed time at different stages in classification process.</p>

<p>Recording <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5#file-index-js-L12-L20">memory usage</a> allows me to modify the maximum memory allocated to the function for optimal performance and cost. Node.js provides a <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.11/api/all.html#process.memoryUsage">standard library API</a> to retrieve memory usage for the current process. Logging these values allows me to inspect memory usage at different stages.</p>

<p>Timing <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/e7c78bbfe4091ed6ace93d1b53cbf6e5#file-index-js-L71">different tasks</a> in the classification process, i.e. model loading, image classification, gives me an insight into how efficient classification is compared to other methods. Node.js has a <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_time_label">standard library API</a> for timers to record and print elapsed time to the console.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h3>Deploy Action</h3>

<ul>
<li>Run the following command with the <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli">IBM Cloud CLI</a> to create the action.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
ibmcloud fn action create classify --docker &lt;IMAGE_NAME&gt; index.js
</code></p>

<p><em>Replace <code>&lt;IMAGE_NAME&gt;</code> with the public Docker Hub image identifier for the custom runtime. Use <code>jamesthomas/action-nodejs-v8:tfjs</code> if you haven't built this manually.</em></p>

<h3>Testing It Out</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Giant_Panda_in_Beijing_Zoo_1.JPG">this image</a> of a Panda from Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Giant_Panda_in_Beijing_Zoo_1.JPG"></p>

<p><code>sh
wget http://bit.ly/2JYSal9 -O panda.jpg
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Invoke the action with the Base64 encoded image as an input parameter.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
 ibmcloud fn action invoke classify -r -p image $(base64 panda.jpg)
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Returned JSON message contains classification probabilities. 🐼🐼🐼</li>
</ul>


<p>```json
{
  "results":  [{</p>

<pre><code>className: 'giant panda, panda, panda bear, coon bear',
probability: 0.9993536472320557
</code></pre>

<p>  }]
}
```</p>

<h3>Activation Details</h3>

<ul>
<li>Retrieve logging output for the last activation to show performance data.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>sh
ibmcloud fn activation logs --last
</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Profiling and memory usage details are logged to stdout</em></strong></p>

<p><code>sh

</code></p>

<p><code>main</code> is the total elapsed time for the action handler. <code>mn_model.classify</code> is the elapsed time for the image classification. Cold start requests print an extra log message with model loading time, <code>loadModel: 394.547ms</code>.</p>

<h2>Performance Results</h2>

<p>Invoking the <code>classify</code> action 1000 times for both cold and warm activations (using 256MB memory) generated the following performance results.</p>

<h3>warm invocations</h3>

<p><img src="/images/tfjs-serverless/warm-activations.png" title="Warm Activation Performance Results" ></p>

<p>Classifications took an average of <strong>316 milliseconds to process when using warm environments</strong>. Looking at the timing data, converting the Base64 encoded JPEG into the input tensor took around 100 milliseconds. Running the model classification task was in the 200 - 250 milliseconds range.</p>

<h3>cold invocations</h3>

<p><img src="/images/tfjs-serverless/cold-activations.png" title="Cold Activation Performance Results" ></p>

<p>Classifications took an average of <strong>1260 milliseconds to process when using cold environments</strong>. These requests incur penalties for initialising new runtime containers and loading models from the filesystem. Both of these tasks took around 400 milliseconds each.</p>

<p><em>One disadvantage of using custom runtime images in Apache OpenWhisk is the lack of <a href="https://medium.com/openwhisk/squeezing-the-milliseconds-how-to-make-serverless-platforms-blazing-fast-aea0e9951bd0">pre-warmed containers</a>. Pre-warming is used to reduce cold start times by starting runtime containers before they are needed. This is not supported for non-standard runtime images.</em></p>

<h3>classification cost</h3>

<p>IBM Cloud Functions <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/pricing">provides a free tier</a> of 400,000 GB/s per month. Each further second of execution is charged at $0.000017 per GB of memory allocated. Execution time is rounded up to the nearest 100ms.</p>

<p>If all activations were warm, a user could execute <strong>more than 4,000,000 classifications per month in the free tier</strong> using an action with 256MB. Once outside the free tier, around 600,000 further invocations would cost just over $1.</p>

<p>If all activations were cold, a user could execute <strong>more than 1,2000,000 classifications per month in the free tier</strong> using an action with 256MB. Once outside the free tier, around 180,000 further invocations would cost just over $1.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>TensorFlow.js brings the power of deep learning to JavaScript developers. Using pre-trained models with the TensorFlow.js library makes it simple to extend JavaScript applications with complex machine learning tasks with minimal effort and code.</p>

<p>Getting a local script to run image classification was relatively simple, but converting to a serverless function came with more challenges! Apache OpenWhisk restricts the maximum application size to 50MB and native libraries dependencies were much larger than this limit.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Apache OpenWhisk's custom runtime support allowed us to resolve all these issues. By building a custom runtime with native dependencies and models files, those libraries can be used on the platform without including them in the deployment package.</p>

    <id>http://jthomas.github.com/jthomas/blog/2018/08/07/machine-learning-in-node-dot-js-with-tensorflow-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a> is a new version of the popular open-source library which brings deep learning to JavaScript. Developers can now define, train, and run machine learning models using the <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/">high-level library API</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/">Pre-trained models</a> mean developers can now easily perform complex tasks like <a href="https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/">visual recognition</a>, <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos/performance_rnn/index.html#2|2,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1|1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1|1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1|false">generating music</a> or <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/posenet/camera.html">detecting human poses</a> with just a few lines of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Having started as a front-end library for web browsers, recent updates added <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node">experimental support</a> for Node.js. This allows TensorFlow.js to be used in backend JavaScript applications without having to use Python.</p>

<p><em>Reading about the library, I wanted to test it out with a simple task...</em> 🧐</p>

<blockquote><p> <strong>Use TensorFlow.js to perform visual recognition on images using JavaScript from Node.js</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/#getting-started">documentation</a> and <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/webcam-transfer-learning.html">example code</a> provided uses the library in a browser. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet">Project utilities</a> provided to simplify loading and using pre-trained models have not yet been extended with Node.js support. Getting this working did end up with me spending a lot of time reading the Typescript source files for the library. 👎</p>

<p>However, after a few days' hacking, I managed to get <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/145610bdeda2638d94fab9a397eb1f1d">this completed</a>! Hurrah! 🤩</p>

<p><em>Before we dive into the code, let's start with an overview of the different TensorFlow libraries.</em></p>

<h2>TensorFlow</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> is an open-source software library for machine learning applications. TensorFlow can be used to implement neural networks and other deep learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Released by Google in November 2015, TensorFlow was originally a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/">Python library</a>. It used either CPU or GPU-based computation for training and evaluating machine learning models. The library was initially designed to run on high-performance servers with expensive GPUs.</p>

<p>Recent updates have extended the software to run in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and web browsers.</p>

<h3>TensorFlow Lite</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/">Tensorflow Lite</a>, a lightweight version of the library for mobile and embedded devices, was released in May 2017. This was accompanied by a new series of pre-trained deep learning models for vision recognition tasks, called <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html">MobileNet</a>. MobileNet models were designed to work efficiently in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.</p>

<h3>TensorFlow.js</h3>

<p>Following Tensorflow Lite, <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-js-machine-learning-in-javascript-bf3eab376db">TensorFlow.js</a> was announced in March 2018. This version of the library was designed to run in the browser, building on an earlier project called <a href="https://twitter.com/deeplearnjs">deeplearn.js</a>. WebGL provides GPU access to the library. Developers use a JavaScript API to train, load and run models.</p>

<p>TensorFlow.js was recently extended to run on Node.js, using an <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node">extension library</a> called <code>tfjs-node</code>.</p>

<p><em>The Node.js extension is an alpha release and still under active development.</em></p>

<h4>Importing Existing Models Into TensorFlow.js</h4>

<p>Existing TensorFlow and Keras models can be executed using the TensorFlow.js library. Models need converting to a new format <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter">using this tool</a> before execution. Pre-trained and converted models for image classification, pose detection and k-nearest neighbours are <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models">available on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Using TensorFlow.js in Node.js</h2>

<h3>Installing TensorFlow Libraries</h3>

<p>TensorFlow.js can be installed from the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM registry</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs">Core TensorFlow.js library</a></li>
<li><code>@tensorflow/tfjs-node</code> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node">TensorFlow.js Node.js extension</a></li>
<li><code>@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu</code> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu">TensorFlow.js Node.js extension with GPU support</a></li>
</ul>


<p><code>
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node
// or...
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu
</code></p>

<p>Both Node.js extensions use native dependencies which will be compiled on demand.</p>

<h3>Loading TensorFlow Libraries</h3>

<p>TensorFlow's <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/">JavaScript API</a> is exposed from the core library. Extension modules to enable Node.js support do not expose additional APIs.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs')
// Load the binding (CPU computation)
require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node')
// Or load the binding (GPU computation)
require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu')
</code></p>

<h3>Loading TensorFlow Models</h3>

<p>TensorFlow.js provides an <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models">NPM library</a> (<code>tfjs-models</code>) to ease loading pre-trained &amp; converted models for <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet">image classification</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet">pose detection</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/knn-classifier">k-nearest neighbours</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet">MobileNet model</a> used for image classification is a deep neural network trained to <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/imagenet_classes.ts">identify 1000 different classes</a>.</p>

<p>In the project's README, the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet#via-npm">following example code</a> is used to load the model.</p>

<p>```javascript
import * as mobilenet from '@tensorflow-models/mobilenet';</p>

<p>// Load the model.
const model = await mobilenet.load();
```</p>

<p><strong>One of the first challenges I encountered was that this does not work on Node.js.</strong></p>

<p><code>
Error: browserHTTPRequest is not supported outside the web browser.
</code></p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/index.ts#L27">source code</a>, the <code>mobilenet</code> library is a wrapper around the underlying <code>tf.Model</code> class. When the <code>load()</code> method is called, it automatically downloads the correct model files from an external HTTP address and instantiates the TensorFlow model.</p>

<p>The Node.js extension does not yet support HTTP requests to dynamically retrieve models. Instead, models must be manually loaded from the filesystem.</p>

<p><em>After reading the source code for the library, I managed to create a work-around...</em></p>

<h4>Loading Models From a Filesystem</h4>

<p>Rather than calling the module's <code>load</code> method, if the <code>MobileNet</code> class is created manually, the auto-generated <code>path</code> variable which contains the HTTP address of the model can be overwritten with a local filesystem path. Having done this, calling the <code>load</code> method on the class instance will trigger the <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/model-save-load.html">filesystem loader class</a>, rather than trying to use the browser-based HTTP loader.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const path = "mobilenet/model.json"
const mn = new mobilenet.MobileNet(1, 1);
mn.path = `file://${path}`
await mn.load()
</code></p>

<p><strong>Awesome, it works!</strong></p>

<p><em>But how where do the models files come from?</em></p>

<h3>MobileNet Models</h3>

<p>Models for TensorFlow.js consist of two file types, a model configuration file stored in JSON and model weights in a binary format. Model weights are often sharded into multiple files for better caching by browsers.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/index.ts#L68-L76">automatic loading code</a> for MobileNet models, models configuration and weight shards are retrieved from a public storage bucket at this address.</p>

<p><code>
https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v${version}_${alpha}_${size}/
</code></p>

<p>The template parameters in the URL refer to the model versions listed <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md#pre-trained-models">here</a>. Classification accuracy results for each version are also shown on that page.</p>

<p><em>According to the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/index.ts#L36">source code</a>, only MobileNet v1 models can be loaded using the <code>tensorflow-models/mobilenet</code> library.</em></p>

<p>The HTTP retrieval code loads the <code>model.json</code> file from this location and then recursively fetches all referenced model weights shards. These files are in the format <code>groupX-shard1of1</code>.</p>

<h4>Downloading Models Manually</h4>

<p>Saving all model files to a filesystem can be achieved by retrieving the model configuration file, parsing out the referenced weight files and downloading each weight file manually.</p>

<p><strong>I want to use the MobileNet V1 Module with 1.0 alpha value and image size of 224 pixels.</strong> This gives me the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json">following URL</a> for the model configuration file.</p>

<p><code>
https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json
</code></p>

<p>Once this file has been downloaded locally, I can use the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><code>jq</code> tool</a> to parse all the weight file names.</p>

<p><code>
$ cat model.json | jq -r ".weightsManifest[].paths[0]"
group1-shard1of1
group2-shard1of1
group3-shard1of1
...
</code></p>

<p>Using the <code>sed</code> tool, I can prefix these names with the HTTP URL to generate URLs for each weight file.</p>

<p><code>
$ cat model.json | jq -r ".weightsManifest[].paths[0]" | sed 's/^/https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/tfjs-models\/tfjs\/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224\//'
https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/group1-shard1of1
https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/group2-shard1of1
https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/group3-shard1of1
...
</code></p>

<p>Using the <code>parallel</code> and <code>curl</code> commands, I can then download all of these files to my local directory.</p>

<p><code>
cat model.json | jq -r ".weightsManifest[].paths[0]" | sed 's/^/https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/tfjs-models\/tfjs\/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224\//' |  parallel curl -O
</code></p>

<h3>Classifying Images</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet#via-npm">This example code</a> is provided by TensorFlow.js to demonstrate returning classifications for an image.</p>

<p>```javascript
const img = document.getElementById('img');</p>

<p>// Classify the image.
const predictions = await model.classify(img);
```</p>

<p><strong>This does not work on Node.js due to the lack of a DOM.</strong></p>

<p>The <code>classify</code> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/index.ts#L143-L155">method</a> accepts numerous DOM elements (<code>canvas</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>image</code>) and will automatically retrieve and convert image bytes from these elements into a <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/index.html#tensor3d"><code>tf.Tensor3D</code> class</a> which is used as the input to the model. Alternatively, the <code>tf.Tensor3D</code> input can be passed directly.</p>

<p><strong>Rather than trying to use an external package to simulate a DOM element in Node.js, I found it easier to construct the <code>tf.Tensor3D</code> manually.</strong></p>

<h4>Generating Tensor3D from an Image</h4>

<p>Reading the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/blob/master/src/kernels/backend_cpu.ts#L126-L140">source code</a> for the method used to turn DOM elements into Tensor3D classes, the following input parameters are used to generate the Tensor3D class.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const values = new Int32Array(image.height * image.width * numChannels);
// fill pixels with pixel channel bytes from image
const outShape = [image.height, image.width, numChannels];
const input = tf.tensor3d(values, outShape, 'int32');
</code></p>

<p><code>pixels</code> is a 2D array of type (Int32Array) which contains a sequential list of channel values for each pixel. <code>numChannels</code> is the number of channel values per pixel.</p>

<h4>Creating Input Values For JPEGs</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpeg-js"><code>jpeg-js</code> library</a> is a pure javascript JPEG encoder and decoder for Node.js. Using this library the RGB values for each pixel can be extracted.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const pixels = jpeg.decode(buffer, true);
</code></p>

<p>This will return a <code>Uint8Array</code> with four channel values (<code>RGBA</code>) for each pixel (<code>width * height</code>). The MobileNet model only uses the three colour channels (<code>RGB</code>) for classification, ignoring the alpha channel. This code converts the four channel array into the correct three channel version.</p>

<p>```javascript
const numChannels = 3;
const numPixels = image.width * image.height;
const values = new Int32Array(numPixels * numChannels);</p>

<p>for (let i = 0; i &lt; numPixels; i++) {
  for (let channel = 0; channel &lt; numChannels; ++channel) {</p>

<pre><code>values[i * numChannels + channel] = pixels[i * 4 + channel];
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<h4>MobileNet Models Input Requirements</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md#mobilenet_v1">MobileNet model</a> being used classifies images of width and height 224 pixels. Input tensors must contain float values, between -1 and 1, for each of the three channels pixel values.</p>

<p>Input values for images of different dimensions needs to be re-sized before classification. Additionally, pixels values from the JPEG decoder are in the range <em>0 - 255</em>, rather than <em>-1 to 1</em>. These values also need converting prior to classification.</p>

<p><strong>TensorFlow.js has library methods to make this process easier but, fortunately for us, the <code>tfjs-models/mobilenet</code> library <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/index.ts#L103-L114">automatically handles</a> this issue!</strong> 👍</p>

<p>Developers can pass in Tensor3D inputs of type <code>int32</code>  and different dimensions to the  <code>classify</code> method and it converts the input to the correct format prior to classification. Which means there's nothing to do... Super 🕺🕺🕺.</p>

<h4>Obtaining Predictions</h4>

<p>MobileNet models in Tensorflow are trained to recognise entities from the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/imagenet_classes.ts">top 1000 classes</a> in the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> dataset. The models output the probabilities that each of those entities is in the image being classified.</p>

<p><em>The full list of trained classes for the model being used can be found in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/imagenet_classes.ts">this file</a>.</em></p>

<p>The <code>tfjs-models/mobilenet</code> library exposes a <code>classify</code> method on the <code>MobileNet</code> class to return the top X classes with highest probabilities from an image input.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const predictions = await mn_model.classify(input, 10);
</code></p>

<p><code>predictions</code> is an array of X classes and probabilities in the following format.</p>

<p><code>javascript
{
  className: 'panda',
  probability: 0.9993536472320557
}
</code></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Having worked how to use the TensorFlow.js library and MobileNet models on Node.js, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/145610bdeda2638d94fab9a397eb1f1d">this script</a> will classify an image given as a command-line argument.</p>

<h3>source code</h3>

<ul>
<li>Save this script file and package descriptor to local files.</li>
</ul>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/jthomas/145610bdeda2638d94fab9a397eb1f1d.js"></script>


<h3>testing it out</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Download the model files to a <code>mobilenet</code> directory using the instructions above.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the project dependencies using NPM
<code>
npm install
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Download a sample JPEG file to classify
<code>
wget http://bit.ly/2JYSal9 -O panda.jpg
</code>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Giant_Panda_in_Beijing_Zoo_1.JPG"></p></li>
<li><p>Run the script with the model file and input image as arguments.
<code>
node script.js mobilenet/model.json panda.jpg
</code></p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>If everything worked, the following output should be printed to the console.</strong></p>

<p>```javascript
classification results: [ {</p>

<pre><code>className: 'giant panda, panda, panda bear, coon bear',
probability: 0.9993536472320557 
</code></pre>

<p>} ]
```</p>

<p>The image is correctly classified as containing a Panda with 99.93% probability! 🐼🐼🐼</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>TensorFlow.js brings the power of deep learning to JavaScript developers. Using pre-trained models with the TensorFlow.js library makes it simple to extend JavaScript applications with complex machine learning tasks with minimal effort and code.</p>

<p>Having been released as a browser-based library, TensorFlow.js has now been extended to work on Node.js, although not all of the tools and utilities support the new runtime. With a few days' hacking, I was able to use the library with the MobileNet models for visual recognition on images from a local file.</p>

<p>Getting this working in the Node.js runtime means I now move on to my next idea... making this run inside a serverless function! Come back soon to read about my next adventure with TensorFlow.js. 👋</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Debugging serverless applications is one of the <a href="https://www.stackery.io/blog/the-serverless-learning-curve/">most challenging issues</a> developers face when using serverless platforms. How can you use debugging tools without any access to the runtime environment?</p>

<p>Last week, I worked out <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasj/status/1013006648439443458">how to expose the Node.js debugger</a> in the Docker environment used for the application runtime in Apache OpenWhisk.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Using the remote debugging service, we can set breakpoints and step through action handlers live, rather than just being reliant on logs and metrics to diagnose bugs.</p>

<p><strong>So, how does this work?</strong></p>

<p><em>Let's find out more about how Apache OpenWhisk executes serverless functions...</em></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a> is the open-source serverless platform which powers <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/">IBM Cloud Functions</a>. OpenWhisk <a href="https://medium.com/openwhisk/uncovering-the-magic-how-serverless-platforms-really-work-3cb127b05f71">uses Docker containers</a> to create isolated runtime environments for executing serverless functions.</p>

<p>Containers are started on-demand as invocation requests arrive. Serverless function source files are dynamically injected into the runtime and executed for each invocation. Between invocations, containers are paused and kept in a cache for re-use with further invocations.</p>

<p>The benefit of using an open-source serverless platform is that the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=incubator-openwhisk-runtime">build files</a> used to create runtime images are also open-source. OpenWhisk also automatically builds and publishes all <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openwhisk/">runtime images externally</a> on Docker Hub. Running containers using these images allows us to simulate the remote serverless runtime environment.</p>

<h3>Runtime Images</h3>

<p>All OpenWhisk runtime images are <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openwhisk/">published externally</a> on Docker Hub.</p>

<p>Runtime images <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions-new.md#action-interface">start a HTTP server</a> which listens on port 8080. This HTTP server must implement two API endpoints (<code>/init</code> &amp; <code>/run</code>) accepting HTTP POST requests. The platform uses these endpoints to initialise the runtime with action code and then invoke the action with event parameters.</p>

<p>More details on the API endpoints can be found in this <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2017/01/16/openwhisk-docker-actions/">blog post</a> on creating Docker-based actions.</p>

<h3>Node.js Runtime Image</h3>

<p>This repository contains the source code used to create <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8/">Node.js runtime environment image</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs">https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs</a></p>

<p>Both <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/tree/master/core/nodejs8Action">Node.js 8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/tree/master/core/nodejs6Action">6 runtimes</a>  are built from a <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/tree/master/core/nodejsActionBase">common base image</a>. This base image contains an <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/app.js">Express.js server</a> which handles the platform API requests. The <code>app.js</code> file containing the server <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejs8Action/Dockerfile#L28">is executed</a> when the containers starts.</p>

<p>JavaScript code is injected into the runtime using the <code>/init</code> API. Actions created from source code are <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L76">dynamically evaluated</a> to instantiate the code in the runtime. Actions created from zip files are <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L54">extracted into a temporary directory</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L61">imported as a Node.js module</a>.</p>

<p>Once instantiated, actions are executed using the <code>/run</code> API. Event parameters are come from the request body. Each time a new request is received, the server <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L95">calls the action handler with event parameters</a>. Returned values are serialised as the JSON body in the API response.</p>

<h3>Starting Node.js Runtime Containers</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/">Use this command</a> to start the Node.js runtime container locally.</p>

<p><code>
$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8
</code></p>

<p>Once the container has started, port 8080 on localhost will be mapped to the HTTP service exposed by the runtime environment. This can be used to inject serverless applications into the runtime environment and invoke the serverless function handler with event parameters.</p>

<h2>Node.js Remote Debugging</h2>

<p>Modern versions of the Node.js runtime have a command-line flag (<code>--inspect</code>) to expose a <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html#debugger_advanced_usage">remote debugging service</a>. This service runs a WebSocket server on localhost which implements the <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/">Chrome DevTools Protocol</a>.</p>

<p><code>
$ node --inspect index.js
Debugger listening on 127.0.0.1:9229.
</code></p>

<p>External tools can connect to this port to provide debugging capabilities for Node.js code.</p>

<p>Docker images for the OpenWhisk Node.js runtimes use the <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejs8Action/Dockerfile#L28">following command</a> to start the internal Node.js process. <strong>Remote debugging is not enabled by default.</strong></p>

<p><code>
node --expose-gc app.js
</code></p>

<p>Docker allows containers to override the default image start command using a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/">command line argument</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This command will start the OpenWhisk Node.js runtime container with the remote debugging service enabled.</strong> Binding the HTTP API and WebSocket ports to the host machine allows us to access those services remotely.</p>

<p><code>
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9229:9229 -it openwhisk/action-nodejs-v8 node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 app.js
</code></p>

<p><em>Once a container from the runtime image has started, we can connect our favourite debugging tools...</em></p>

<h3>Chrome Dev Tools</h3>

<p>To connect <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Chrome Dev Tools</a> to the remote Node.js debugging service, follow these steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the following page in Chrome: <a href="chrome://inspect/#devices">chrome://inspect/#devices</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/debugging/devtools.png" title="Chrome Dev Tools" ></p>

<p>Chrome Dev Tools is configured to open a connection on port 9229 on localhost. If the web socket connection succeeds, the debugging target should be listed in the "Remote Target" section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click the "<em>Open dedicated DevTools for Node</em>" link.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the "Sources" panel the JavaScript files loaded by the Node.js process are available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/debugging/devtools-debugging.png" title="Chrome Dev Tools Debugging" ></p>

<p>Setting breakpoints in the <code>runner.js</code> file will allow you to halt execution for debugging upon invocations.</p>

<h3>VSCode</h3>

<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> supports remote debugging of Node.js code using the Chrome Dev Tools protocol. Follow these steps to connect the editor to the remote debugging service.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click the menu item "<em>Debug -> Add Configuration</em>"</li>
<li>Select the "<em>Node.js: Attach to Remote Program</em>" from the Intellisense menu.</li>
<li>Edit the default configuration to have the following values.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "attach",
  "name": "Attach to Remote",
  "address": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 9229,
  "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
}
</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/debugging/vscode.png" title="Visual Studio Code" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Choose the new "<em>attach to remote</em>" debugging profile and click the Run button.</li>
</ul>


<p>The "<em>Loaded Scripts</em>" window will show all the JavaScript files loaded by the Node.js process.</p>

<p><img src="/images/debugging/vscode-debugging.png" title="Visual Studio Code Debugging" ></p>

<p>Setting breakpoints in the <code>runner.js</code> file will allow you to halt execution for debugging upon invocations.</p>

<h3>Breakpoint Locations</h3>

<p>Here are some useful locations to set breakpoints to catch errors in your serverless functions for the OpenWhisk Node.js runtime environments.</p>

<h4>Initialisation Errors - Source Actions</h4>

<p>If you are creating OpenWhisk actions from JavaScript source files, the code is dynamically evaluated during  the <code>/init</code> request at <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L76">this location</a>. Putting a breakpoint here will allow you to catch errors thrown during that <code>eval()</code> call.</p>

<h4>Initialisation Errors - Binary Actions</h4>

<p>If you are creating OpenWhisk actions from a zip file containing JavaScript modules, <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L54">this location</a> is where the archive is extracted in the runtime filesystem. Putting a breakpoint here will catch errors from the extraction call and runtime checks for a valid JavaScript module.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L61">This code</a> is where the JavaScript module is imported once it has been extracted. Putting a breakpoint here will catch errors thrown importing the module into the Node.js environment.</p>

<h4>Action Handler Errors</h4>

<p>For both source file and zipped module actions, <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/core/nodejsActionBase/runner.js#L95">this location</a> is where the action handler is invoked on each <code>/run</code> request. Putting a breakpoint here will catch errors thrown from within action handlers.</p>

<h2>Invoking OpenWhisk Actions</h2>

<p>Once you have attached the debugger to the remote Node.js process, you need to send the API requests to simulate the platform invocations. Runtime containers use separate HTTP endpoints to import the action source code into the runtime environment (<code>/init</code>)  and then fire the invocation requests (<code>/run</code>).</p>

<h4>Generating Init Request Body - Source Files</h4>

<p>If you are creating OpenWhisk actions from JavaScript source files, send the following JSON body in the HTTP POST to the <code>/init</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>```json
{
  "value": {</p>

<pre><code>"main": "&lt;FUNCTION NAME IN SOURCE FILE&gt;",
"code": "&lt;INSERT SOURCE HERE&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p><code>code</code> is the JavaScript source to be evaluated which contains the action handler. <code>main</code> is the function name in the source file used for the action handler.</p>

<p>Using the <code>jq</code> <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">command-line tool</a>, we can create the JSON body for the source code in <code>file.js</code>.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ cat file.js | jq -sR  '{value: {main: "main", code: .}}'
</code></p>

<h4>Generating Init Request Body - Zipped Modules</h4>

<p>If you are creating OpenWhisk actions from a zip file containing JavaScript modules, send the following JSON body in the HTTP POST to the <code>/init</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>```json
{
  "value": {</p>

<pre><code>"main": "&lt;FUNCTION NAME ON JS MODULE&gt;",
"code": "&lt;INSERT BASE64 ENCODED STRING FROM ZIP FILE HERE&gt;",
"binary": true
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p><code>code</code> must be a Base64 encoded string for the zip file. <code>main</code> is the function name returned in the imported JavaScript module to call as the action handler.</p>

<p>Using the <code>jq</code> <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">command-line tool</a>, we can create the JSON body for the zip file in <code>action.zip</code>.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ base64 action.zip | tr -d '\n' | jq -sR '{value: {main: "main", binary: true, code: .}}'
</code></p>

<h4>Sending Init Request</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://httpie.org/">HTTPie</a> tool makes it simple to send HTTP requests from the command-line.</p>

<p>Using this tool, the following command will initialise the runtime container with an OpenWhisk action.</p>

<p>```sh
$ http post localhost:8080/init &lt; init.json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{</p>

<pre><code>"OK": true
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If this HTTP request returns without an error, the action is ready to be invoked.</p>

<p><em>No further initialisation requests are needed unless you want to modify the action deployed.</em></p>

<h4>Generating Run Request Body</h4>

<p>Invocations of the action handler functions are triggered from a HTTP POST to the <code>/run</code> API endpoint.</p>

<p>Invocations parameters are sent in the JSON request body, using a JSON object with a <code>value</code> field.</p>

<p>```json
{
  "value": {</p>

<pre><code>"some-param-name": "some-param-value",
"another-param-name": "another-param-value",
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<h4>Sending Run Request</h4>

<p>Using the <a href="https://httpie.org/">HTTPie</a> tool, the following command will invoke the OpenWhisk action.</p>

<p>```sh
$ http post localhost:8080/run &lt; run.json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{</p>

<pre><code>"msg": "Hello world"
</code></pre>

<p>Returned values from the action handler are serialised as the JSON body in the HTTP response. Issuing further HTTP POST requests to the <code>/run</code> endpoint allows us to re-invoke the action.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Lack of debugging tools is one of the biggest complaints from developers migrating to serverless platforms.</p>

<p>Using an open-source serverless platform helps with this problem, by making it simple to run the same containers locally that are used for the platform's runtime environments. Debugging tools can then be started from inside these local environments to simulate remote access.</p>

<p>In this example, this approach was used to enable the remote debugging service from the OpenWhisk Node.js runtime environment. The same approach could be used for any language and debugging tool needing local access to the runtime environment.</p>

<p>Having access to the Node.js debugger is huge improvement when debugging challenging issues, rather than just being reliant on logs and metrics collected by the platform.</p>
