    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IBM recently launched <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/">OpenWhisk</a>,
their new <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Serverless-Computing">"serverless"</a>
compute platform.</p>

<p>This service allows developers to register small bits of
code that are executed on-demand in response to external events. The
"serverless" stack started in 2014, when Amazon launched
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a>, but is now set to be a major
technology trend in 2016 with IBM, Microsoft and Google all launching their own
solutions.</p>

<p>OpenWhisk is the first <a href="https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk">open-source "serverless" platform</a>. It supports running registered
actions in Node.js, Swift and even executing custom Docker containers.</p>

<p>Playing around with the technology recently, I've created two projects using the platform.</p>

<h2>OpenWhisk Client Library</h2>

<p>OpenWhisk exposes a <a href="https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/reference.md#rest-api">RESTful API</a>
for interacting with the service. Wrapping this API with a
<a href="https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-client-js">small client library</a> makes it easy for developers to interact with the service from JavaScript.</p>

<p>This library has been donated back to the OpenWhisk project and is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/openwhisk">available through NPM</a>.</p>

<p><code>javascript
const openwhisk = require('openwhisk')
const ow = openwhisk({api: 'https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/', api_key: '...', namespace: '...'})
ow.actions.invoke({actionName: 'action'}).then(result =&gt; {
  // result is service response
})
</code></p>

<h2>Whiskify</h2>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/whiskify">project</a>, available through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/openwhisk">NPM</a>, makes it easy to run arbitary JavaScript
functions as OpenWhisk actions.  Passing a reference to a JavaScript function
into the module, an OpenWhisk action is created using the function source.  The
module returns a new JavaScript function, that when executed, will call the
remote action and returns a Promise with the service response.</p>

<p>``` javascript
const whiskify = require('whiskify')({api: 'https://', api_key: '...', namespace: '...'})
const action = whiskify(function (item) { return item + 1; })</p>

<p>action(1).then(function (result) {
  // == 2
})</p>

<p>action.map([1, 2, 3, 4]).then(function (result) {
 // == [2, 3, 4, 5]
})</p>

<p>action.delete()
```</p>

<p>This project uses the client library above.</p>

    <link href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/01/22/debugging-live-containers-on-ibm-bluemix/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-22T16:57:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/01/22/debugging-live-containers-on-ibm-bluemix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last few months, I've been using the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack">ELK stack</a> to <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management.html">collect logs</a> from my
Cloud Foundry applications. This service has been deployed on IBM Bluemix using
a Docker container, previously detailed in <a href="jamesthom.as/blog/2015/07/08/making-logs-awesome-with-elasticsearch-and-docker/">this blog post</a>, and running happily
until it ran into issues this week.</p>

<p>Trying to load the Kibana web application, the server was returning <em>connection
refused</em> errors. Looking at the container in the <a href="http://bluemix.net">IBM Bluemix</a> dashboard showed
no obvious signs of issues. Reviewing the <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_ml_ov.html">container log output</a> uncovered nothing
indicating what had failed.</p>

<p>Hmmm...</p>

<p><strong>Fixing this issue would require me to start debugging from within the live
container, but how?</strong></p>

<p>This container image had not included an SSH daemon that would allow remote
access over SSH.</p>

<p>Looking over the <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html">documentation</a> for the <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_ov.html#container_cli_cfic">IBM Containers plugin</a> for the Cloud
Foundry CLI, I noticed the <em>exec</em> command.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Docker exec allows a user to spawn a process inside their Docker container via<br/>the Docker API and CLI.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Since Docker 1.3, released in October 2014, the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/"><em>exec</em> command</a> has allowed users to
run new commands within existing containers.</p>

<p>The IBM Containers implementation now <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_reference_native-docker.html">supports this Docker command</a>.</p>

<p>Using the IBM Containers plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI, I can find the
container id for the instance I want to debug and then start a bash shell to
start resolving my issue.</p>

<p><code>sh
$ cf ic ps
$ cf ic exec -it &lt;container_id&gt; /bin/bash
</code></p>

<p>Having a live shell to my container allowed me to resolve the issue within a
few minutes, without having to affect the running state of the container. This
command also removes the need to keep an SSH daemon running on containers for
remote access.</p>

<p>For more information on the subset of Docker commands supported by IBM
Containers, see the following <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_reference_native-docker.html">documentation</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/01/05/cfbot/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-05T10:15:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/01/05/cfbot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cloud Foundry makes it so easy to build, deploy and manage applications that it
can be a struggle just to keep up with development progress...</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"Who is restarting this application?"<br/>"What is this new service instance?"<br/>"When did this application instance run out of memory?"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Development teams are increasingly using <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> to
collaborate on projects and using custom bots to manage and monitor
applications, triggered through the channel messages. This approach,
popularised by Github, has now become known as
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github">"ChatOps"</a>. Using group
chat for development projects gives
<a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/what-is-chatops/">greater operational visibility to everyone in the team</a>.</p>

<p>Slack has exploded in use over the past two years, recently signing up more
than a <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/27/slack-one-million-connected/">million active users</a>.
The platform <a href="https://api.slack.com">publishes an API</a> for writing <em>bots</em> that
respond automatically to messages, allowing users to write custom integrations
for external services.</p>

<p>Users can register webhooks to receive channel messages, based upon keyword
triggers, and allow bots to reply with new channel messages. The platform also
provides a websocket channel with registered bots for real-time communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Could we write a custom bot for monitoring applications on the Cloud Foundry
platform?</em></strong></p>

<p>The bot would publish notifications about applications and services into group
channels, helping keep teams updated with platform events in real-time.</p>

<h2>Cloud Foundry Monitoring APIs</h2>

<p>Cloud Foundry provides access to the platform through a series of <a href="https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org">RESTful APIs</a>,
exposed by the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html">Cloud Controller</a>
component.  User commands from the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/">CF CLI tool</a> are translated into calls
to these APIs.</p>

<p><em>Tip: Setting the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/troubleshoot-app-health.html#trace"><em>CF_TRACE</em> environment parameter</a>
to <strong>true</strong> will show the API calls generated by the CLI commands.</em></p>

<p>Platform user account credentials are used to <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-Tokens.md">obtain OAuth2 tokens</a>
for authenticating service calls.</p>

<p>Looking at the documentation, there's an <a href="https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/226/events/list_all_events.html">endpoint for retrieving all platform events</a>.
This API is used to retrieve events for an application when using the CF CLI
<em>events</em> command. Events can be filtered by the application, event type and
timestamps. Responses include events about changes to applications, services
and service instances.</p>

<p><em>Polling this API, with timestamp filtering to ignore old events, we can
retrieve a continuous stream of new platform events.</em></p>

<h2>Slack Integration</h2>

<p>Setting up a <a href="https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot">new bot integration</a> for a Slack group provides you with a token
you can use to authenticate with the <a href="https://api.slack.com/rtm">Real-Time Messaging API</a>.  Rather than
having to implement the Websocket-based API handler ourselves, we can use one
of the many existing <a href="https://api.slack.com/community">community libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client">Node.js client library</a>, passing in the authentication token, we just
need to implement callback handlers for the API events.</p>

<p>``` javascript Slack Client
var Slack = require('slack-client')</p>

<p>var slackToken = 'xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE' # Add a bot at https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot and copy the token here.
var autoReconnect = true # Automatically reconnect after an error response from Slack.
var autoMark = true # Automatically mark each message as read after it is processed.</p>

<p>var slack = new Slack(slackToken, autoReconnect, autoMark)
slack.on('message', function (message) {...})
slack.on('error', function (err) {...})
slack.on('open', function () {})</p>

<p>slack.login()
```</p>

<p>When platform events occur, we forward these to any channels the bot is registered in.</p>

<p><em>Plugging together the Cloud Foundry event monitoring code with the Slack bot integration, <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/cfbot">cfbot</a> was born...</em></p>

<h2>cfbot </h2>

<p><img src="/images/cfbot-events.png"></p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/cfbot">Cloud Foundry monitoring bot</a> can be deployed to... Cloud Foundry!</p>

<p>You will need to register the bot with your Slack group to receive an
authentication token. This token, along with login details for a platform
account, need to be created as user-provided service credentials. The bot will
read these service credentials on deployment and start monitoring for events.</p>

<p>Full installation instructions available in the <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/cfbot">project README</a>.</p>

<h2>usage</h2>

<p>cfbot will monitor events from applications in all spaces and organisations that the user account has access to.</p>

<p>Users can filter the applications and events being reported using the apps and
events commands. Both commands take application or event identifiers that are
used to match incoming events. The wildcard '*' identifier can be used to
revert to matching all events.</p>

<pre>
@cf apps // show the currently application filter
@cf apps app_name // add the 'app_name' to the filter list
@cf apps * // reset to the filter to wildcard matching

@cf events // show the currently event filter
@cf events event_type // add the 'event_type' to the filter list
@cf events * // reset to the filter to wildcard matching

@cf status // show the current bot status message

@cf polling_frequency // show the cf events api polling time in seconds
@cf polling_frequency 10 // set the cf events api polling time in seconds
</pre>


<p>The following events are currently registered:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>App Creation and Deletion Events.</em></li>
<li><em>App Lifecycle Events (start, stop, restart, restage)</em></li>
<li><em>Instance Crash Events.</em></li>
<li><em>Service Creation, Deleting and Binding.</em></li>
<li><em>Scaling (memory, CPU, disk)</em></li>
<li><em>Routes Changes (map, unmap)</em></li>
</ul>


<h2>Other bots</h2>

<p>Other people have written Cloud Foundry bots before cfbot. Here are the other projects I discovered that might be useful...</p>

    <link href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/01/04/updated-ibm-watson-nodes/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-04T15:45:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/node-red-updates.png"></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I made a <a href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2015/04/22/ibm-watson-nodes-for-nodered/">major upate</a> to the Node-RED nodes for the IBM
Watson services available through IBM Bluemix. Since then, the IBM Watson team
has been <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog">busy</a>, with lots of changes to APIs. I've recently been working through
these changes, updating the nodes, to ensure they work against the latest APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Updates to these nodes have now been finished and are available through the
<a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/node-red-starter/">boilerplate</a> on IBM Bluemix or by installing the <a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red-bluemix-nodes">IBM Bluemix Nodes</a> package
locally.</strong></p>

<p>If you have an existing Node-RED instance running in IBM Bluemix, please review
the <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/Node-RED/nodered.html#nodered">documentation</a> for upgrade instructions.</p>

<p>If you encounter any issues, please raise a <a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red-bluemix-nodes/issues">issue on Github</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://jamesthom.as/blog/2015/09/18/node-dot-js-v4-in-cloud-foundry/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-18T17:33:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesthom.as/blog/2015/09/18/node-dot-js-v4-in-cloud-foundry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.0.0/">released the latest version</a>
of their project, v4.0.0. This release, representing the convergence of io.js with the original Node.js
project, came with lots of exciting features like <a href="http://apmblog.dynatrace.com/2015/09/05/all-you-need-to-know-about-node-js-4-0/">improved ES6 support</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry already <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/node-tips.html">supports multiple versions</a> of the Node.js runtime.
Developers select the desired runtime version using a parameter in their
application's <a href="http://browsenpm.org/package.json">package descriptor</a>.</p>

<p><em>So, we just update package.json to include "4.0.0" and re-deploy our application?</em></p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2783">unresolved technical issue</a>
delaying the <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1042066/stories/102941608">release</a> of "official"
Node.js v4 support for the platform. 😿</p>

<p><em>Can we add support ourselves?</em></p>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong></p>

<p>To do this, we need to explore how Cloud Foundry configures the runtime
environment for applications.</p>

<h2>Buildpacks</h2>

<p>Rather than hardcoding supported runtimes and frameworks into the platform,
Cloud Foundry borrowed the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/"><em>buildpack model</em></a> from Heroku. Buildpacks are a
<a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/custom.html#custom-buildpacks">set of scripts</a>, run by the platform during deployment, to configure the runtime
environment.</p>

<p>Users can set an explicit buildpack for an application, <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#buildpack">using the manifest</a>, or let
the platform decide. Buildpacks for <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/">common runtimes</a> are pre-installed with the platform.
Buildpacks set through the manifest can point to external URLs, allowing users to create
new buildpacks supporting custom runtimes.</p>

<p>Each buildpack must contain the following files as executable scripts.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bin/detect</strong> - <em>determine whether a buildpack is suitable for an application.</em></li>
<li><strong>bin/compile</strong> - <em>install and configure the runtime environment on the DEA.</em></li>
<li><strong>bin/release</strong> - <em>provide metadata with information on executing application.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Full details on existing buildpacks for the platform are available <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks">here</a>.</p>

<p>Node.js is supported as an "official" buildpack by the platform. This will be
the one we will modify to add support for the latest version of the runtime.</p>

<h2>Node.js Buildpack </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack">This</a> is the Node.js
buildpack for Cloud Foundry. Applications using this buildpack can select the
version of Node.js to install using the engine parameter in the package
descriptor.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/blob/master/bin/compile"><em>bin/compile</em></a>
script will show us how the Node.js runtime is installed during deployment.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/blob/master/bin/compile#L66-L88">snippet</a> handles
accessing the Node.js version configured, using the node.engine parameter from package.json, before calling
<em>install_nodejs</em> to install the correct runtime package.</p>

<pre>
install_bins() {
  local node_engine=$(read_json "$BUILD_DIR/package.json" ".engines.node")
  local npm_engine=$(read_json "$BUILD_DIR/package.json" ".engines.npm")

  echo "engines.node (package.json):  ${node_engine:-unspecified}"
  echo "engines.npm (package.json):   ${npm_engine:-unspecified (use default)}"
  echo ""

  warn_node_engine "$node_engine"
  install_nodejs "$node_engine" "$BUILD_DIR/.heroku/node"
  install_npm "$npm_engine" "$BUILD_DIR/.heroku/node"
  warn_old_npm
}
</pre>


<p>Searching through the buildpack for this function, it's in the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/blob/master/lib/binaries.sh">lib/binaries.sh</a>
file.  Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/blob/master/lib/binaries.sh#L10-L25">function code</a>, it translates the version number into a
URL pointing to an archive with the pre-compiled Node.js binary. This archive
file is downloaded, extracted and installed into the runtime environment.</p>

<p>Translating Node.js version identifiers into archive URLs uses a special file
in the buildpack, <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/blob/master/manifest.yml">manifest.yml</a>. This file maps every supported version to a
pre-built binary location.</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/commit/8536a85cd69c867dc797c9586839a1373da4fd9d">previous commits</a> to the Node.js buildpack, adding support for additional
versions of Node.js simply requires updating this file with the extra version
identifier and archive URL.</p>

<p>Until the Cloud Foundry team updates the buildpack to support Node.js v4, they won't
provide an external archive containing the pre-built runtime environment.</p>

<p><em>Where can we find a suitable build of the Node.js binary?</em></p>

<h2>Node.js Runtime Binaries </h2>

<p>Cloud Foundry borrowed the <strong>buildpack</strong> concept from <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">Heroku</a> and still
maintains backwards compatibility with their platform. Heroku buildpacks will
work with Cloud Foundry applications. The Node.js buildpack for Cloud Foundry
is actually still a fork of <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs">Heroku's</a>.</p>

<p>Looking back through the original buildpack source, this URL template is used to translate
Node.js versions to archive URLs being built by Heroku.</p>

<p><em>http://s3pository.heroku.com/node/v$version/node-v$version-$os-$cpu.tar.gz</em></p>

<p>Combining the correct version identifier and platform parameters with this
template gave the following location for a potential build of the Node.js v4
runtime.</p>

<p><a href="">http://s3pository.heroku.com/node/v4.0.0/node-v4.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Running curl against the location successfully downloaded the Node.js v4 binary archive!</p>

<h2>Custom v4 Buildpack</h2>

<p>Forking the Cloud Foundry Node.js buildpack on Github, we can update the
<a href="https://github.com/jthomas/nodejs-v4-buildpack/blob/master/manifest.yml#L57-L62">manifest.yml</a> with the Node.js v4 identifier pointing to the Heroku runtime
archive. This <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/nodejs-v4-buildpack">external Git repository</a> will be used as the buildpack identifier
in the application manfest.</p>

<h2>Deploying with v4</h2>

<p>Having updated our application manifest with the custom buildpack location and
set the updated node version flag, re-deploying our application will start it
running on Node.js v4.</p>

<p>``` sh
[20:02:29 ~]$ cf app sample-demo-app
Showing health and status for app sample-demo-app in org james.thomas@uk.ibm.com / space dev as james.thomas@uk.ibm.com...

<p>[20:03:13 ~]$
```</p>

<p>Looking at the logs from the deployment we can see the latest Node.js
runtime has been downloaded and installed within our runtime environment.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Buildpacks are a brilliant feature of Cloud Foundry.</p>

<p>Understanding how buildpacks are structured and used by the platform means we
can start customising existing buildpacks and even start creating our own.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to run Node.js applications using v4 on Cloud Foundry today, you
can use the <a href="https://github.com/jthomas/nodejs-v4-buildpack">following buildpack</a>
created using the instructions above.</strong></p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is currently adding support for the version to
the official buildpack, follow their progress <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1042066/stories/102941608">here</a>.</p>
